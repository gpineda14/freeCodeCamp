# freeCodeCamp #

**FreeCodeCamp.com is a website designed to help new users learn how to program through web development**

I decided to start adding my notes and freeCodeCamp projects to a repo to track my efforts and to *hopefully* complete the whole curriculum.

I will add my notes beginning with **Redux**
